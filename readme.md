Description 
--
This is my final project for CSCI E-15. It is a site for a made up organisation called the 'Berry Appreciation Society'. The site is made for the society to share their history, news, and showcase their events. Members can join and create, edit, and delete their own events, as well as join other people's events. 

Log In Information
--
I created a default user that you can use to see member only interactions without having to register. Log in details are as follows:
Email: kit@kit.com
Password: kitkitkit

Outside code
--
I started with a base bootstrap template called Agency (http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/) and built from there. The site also utilises Font Awesome (http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome), JQuery (http://jquery.com), and a handful of JS plug-ins, all listed in the Agency site linked above. And, of course, laravel was used, full details below.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.

Laravel aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality. Happy developers make the best code. To this end, we've attempted to combine the very best of what we have seen in other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented in other languages, such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Sinatra.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the entire framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
